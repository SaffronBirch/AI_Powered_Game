I stand on the winding path outside the modest inn of White Orchard, the scent of pine and fresh river water mingling with the distant cries of a griffin circling the hills. The mist\u2011cloaked valley is dotted with thatched farms, a crumbling keep, and a few wary peasants eyeing the sky, while I keep my silver blade close, ready to track the missing apprentice and test my new potion."

The air hangs heavy with rumours of sea\u2011creature attacks, and I keep my silver blade at the ready, seeking a jarls\u2019 contract and any clue that might lead me to Ciri."
